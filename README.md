# wave
Fun project for practicing game development with Java.

Avoid the bouncing squares for as long as possible. Purchase upgrades with the points earned along the way.

## Concepts Learned
- **Game loop** with tick and render methods
- Input like **mouse and key events**
- **Collisions** between objects on the screen
- Multiple **menu** navigation
- Basic **graphics** and **sounds**

## Improvements Needed
Holy hell does this need refactoring. All of the Enemy classes should inherit from one superclass. The amount of repeated code is insane. Doing this in the ideal OOP way was not the main objective of the project.

I would also tighten up the math. There are many hard-coded numbers that can be stored in various classes as attributes.

## Getting Started
I did not create an installation file or an `.exe` file. Clone the entire repository and run it in your IDE.
